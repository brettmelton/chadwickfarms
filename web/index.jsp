A night-time, motion-sensing light has been installed behind the Mail Room to brighten up the grassy
area when motion is detected.  This should add a bit of security and safety to what has been historically, a very
dark area.<br>

<div>
You may have noticed the new lighting at the front entrance.  If you see Tom out and about, please be sure to thank
him for all his effort in getting the materials as well as coordinating the installation of the light.  The LED light
is currently being powered by the owner of unit 8375 and we are very thankful for their generous agreement to power
the light.

<h1>Welcome to chadwickfarms.net</h1>

<img src="/images/cf_funinsun.png" width="100%" border="1">

<h2>Our Community</h2>

<p>Located near Big Finn Hill Park in north Kirkland, Chadwick Farms is a quiet and family friendly townhouse community of 36 units.
Whether you are looking to start a family, find a relaxing place to retire, or a college student at Bastyr or UW Bothell,
Chadwick Farms accommodates them all.  Our community is close to parks, schools, shopping centers, restaurants, and a few
minutes drive to Interstate 405.</p>

<h2>Neighborhood Watch</h2>

<img src="/images/cf_signlight.png" width="100%" border="1">

<p>One of the most neighborly things you can do for those living nearest you is to watch out over our community.
Nobody is going to expect you to put on a trench coat and patrol the streets, but being alert and cautious
can save another from being a victim of a crime.</p>
<h3>What can you do?</h3>
<p>The Board of Directors would like for you to contact the police department, the board members, and our property management
if you witness or experience a crime.   If you are suspicious about a certain behavior, please call the police immediately.
The police will come out to investigate the concern. After you first contact the police, please contact the board members
so the board can track the reports.  Our community does have limited video surveillance with a short window of dvr recording.
Informing the board as soon as you can will allow for the proper saving of video that may be used for law enforcement.</p>
