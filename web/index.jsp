<h1>Welcome to chadwickfarms.net</h1>

<h2>Welcome to chadwickfarms.net</h2>

Located near Big Fill Hill Park in north Kirkland, Chadwick Farms is a quiet and family friendly townhouse community of 36 units.
Whether you are looking to start a family, find a relaxing place to retire, or a college student at Bastyr or UW Bothell,
Chadwick Farms accommodates them all.  Our community is close to parks, schools, shopping centers, restaurants, and a few
minutes drive to Interstate 405.

<h2>Changing the Guard</h2>

At the 2013 annual board meeting, 3 board members stepped down and 3 new board members were appointed to fill those positions.
The current board members are passionate about serving this community and continuing to make this community one of the
best places to live in Kirkland.   We would love to hear from you so please let us know your thoughts.

<h2>Neighborhood Watch</h2>

One of the most neighborly things you can do for those living nearest you is to watch out over our community.
Nobody is going to expect you to put on a trench coat and patrol the streets, but being alert and cautious
can save another from being a victim of a crime.
<h3>What can you do?</h3>
The Board of Directors would like for you to contact the police department, the board members, and our property management
if you witness or experience a crime.   If you are suspicious about a certain individual, please contact the board members
immediately.  Our community does have limited video surveillance with a short window of dvr recording.   Informing the board
as soon as you can will allow for the proper saving of video that may be used for law enforcement.
